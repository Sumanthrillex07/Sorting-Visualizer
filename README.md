# Sorting-Visualizer
### This is a web application that visualizes classic sorting algorithms. It is built using JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
### Here is the website [link](https://sortingvisualise07.netlify.app).
## Features
* The visualizer supports a variety of sorting algorithms
    * Bubble Sort
    * Selection Sort
    * Insertion Sort
    * Merge Sort
    * Quick Sort
    * Heap Sort
* The visualizer can be used to visualize the sorting process for any array of numbers.
* The visualizer can be customized to change the colors of the bars, the speed of the animation, and other settings.
* It also provides with the time and space complexities of the sorting algorithms.
## Usage
To use the visualizer, simply select the size of the array and the speed and click on the sorting algorithm. The visualizer will then animate the sorting process.
## Usage of DSA sorting algorithms
The visualizer uses a variety of data structures and algorithms to visualize the sorting process. For example, it uses an array to store the numbers to be sorted. The visualizer also uses a variety of sorting algorithms, including bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.
## The visualizer is a great way to learn about sorting algorithms and data structures. It is also a fun way to visualize the sorting process. I hope you enjoy using it! :U+1F5A4:
